    "\n",
    "        Solution:\n",
    "        The expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore, $x-2 \\\\ge 0$, so $x\\\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\\\ge 0$, so $x \\\\le 5$. Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain of the expression is $\\\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.

    "        Solution:\n",
    "        If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\\\cdot 12\\\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\\\cdot15\\\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n30n&=480\\\\\\n\\\\Rightarrow\\\\qquad n&=480/30=\\\\boxed{16}\\n\\\\end{align*}\\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $16$.
