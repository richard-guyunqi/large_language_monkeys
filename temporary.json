    "Here are some few-shot examples for your understanding:\n\nProblem:\nDetermine the domain of the function \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}\\).\n\nSolution:\nThe expressions under each square root must be non-negative. Hence, \\(x-2 \\ge 0\\) implies \\(x \\ge 2\\), and \\(5 - x \\ge 0\\) implies \\(x \\le 5\\). Additionally, the denominator must not be zero, which means \\(5 - x > 0\\), leading to \\(x < 5\\). Thus, the domain of the function is \\(\\boxed{[2, 5)}\\).\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\([2, 5)\\). I hope that is correct.\n\nProblem:\nGiven \\(\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2\\) and \\(\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12\\), find \\(\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B})\\).\n\nSolution:\nWe have \\(\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = \\boxed{24}\\).\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(24\\). I hope that is correct.\n\nProblem:\nTerrell typically lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he switches to lifting two 15-pound weights, how many repetitions would Terrell need to perform to lift the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nWhen Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of \\(2 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 20 = 480\\) pounds. If he switches to lifting two 15-pound weights for \\(n\\) repetitions, he will lift a total of \\(2 \\cdot 15 \\cdot n = 30n\\) pounds. Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for \\(n\\):\n\\begin{align*}\n30n &= 480\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad n &= 480 / 30 = \\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(16\\). I hope that is correct.\n\nProblem:\nGiven the system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y &= a,\\\\\n6y-9x &= b.\n\\end{align*}\n\nand knowing it has a solution \\((x, y)\\) where both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are non-zero, find \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), assuming \\(b \\neq 0\\).\n\nSolution:\nBy multiplying the first equation by \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\), we get\n\n\\[6y - 9x = -\\frac{3}{2}a.\\]\n\nSince \\(6y - 9x = b\\), we have\n\n\\[-\\frac{3}{2}a = b\\Rightarrow \\frac{a}{b} = \\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.\\]\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\). I hope that is correct.\n\nNow it is your turn.\n\nProblem:\nJulie baked cupcakes for her family at home and for a party at school. She decorated 4 cupcakes with red frosting, 2 cupcakes with orange frosting, 2 with yellow, 2 with green, 3 with blue, and the last 3 with violet frosting. Each cupcake is decorated with only one color of frosting. Julie intends to take exactly 10 of the cupcakes to her party and will take either all the cupcakes of a specific color or none of them. How many different combinations of cupcakes could she take to her party?\n\nSolution:",
    "Here are several few-shot examples for you to understand:\n\nProblem:\nDetermine the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\nSolution:\nThe terms inside each square root must be non-negative. Hence, $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x \\ge 2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Additionally, the denominator cannot be zero, thus $5-x > 0$, which results in $x < 5$. Consequently, the domain of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12$, then calculate $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$.

If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them to lift the same overall weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight. If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight. Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x - 4y &= a,\\\n6y - 9x &= b.\n\\end{align*}\nhas a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero, find $\\frac{a}{b}$, assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y - 9x = -\\frac{3}{2}a.$$ \nSince we also know that $6y - 9x = b$, we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a = b \\Rightarrow \\frac{a}{b} = \\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nNow it's your turn.\n\nProblem:\nJulie baked cupcakes for her family at home and for a party at school.
