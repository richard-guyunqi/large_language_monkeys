If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them to lift the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight. If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight. Matching this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $16$.
